Here’s a **simple lock-free skip list implementation in Go**, focusing on the key operations: insert, search, and delete — using `sync/atomic` for lock-free concurrency. This is a minimal prototype to help you get started building an in-memory DB.

### ⚠️ Notes

- This is a minimal design to demonstrate **lock-free structure** with atomic CAS.
- For real-world production, add:
  - real-world production: Memory reclamation (hazard pointers or epoch-based GC).
  - Support for custom keys and comparators (generics).
  - Advanced concurrency safety and benchmarks.

When deleting nodes, they should be retired rather than immediately freed
Periodic cleanup would reclaim memory safely

This is a simplified version of hazard pointers for demonstration

In a real implementation:

You'd need thread-local hazard pointer IDs
Optimize the number of hazard pointers needed
Handle node allocation more efficiently
Add more thorough validation to prevent ABA problems
The basic idea is:

Before reading a node, protect it with a hazard pointer
Before freeing memory, check if any hazard pointers reference it
Only free memory when no hazard pointers point to it

Future Enhancements
Some potential enhancements you could consider:

Persistent storage with WAL (Write-Ahead Log)
Distributed mode with replication
Query language or DSL for more complex operations
Enhanced monitoring and metrics
Snapshot isolation for transactions
